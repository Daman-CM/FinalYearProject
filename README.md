# FinalYearProject
Creating temporal dynamic graph visualizations for Textual Tuples and then measure the graph similarity using Metrics Analysis.


Natural Language Processing was used to create the text tuples I used from pychology papers.
In this project I take those text tuples from three file types and use the information to create temporal dynamic graph visualizations.
I then used metrics to get the structural similarity of the graph relative to each other.
