# FinalYearProject
Creating temporal dynamic graph visualizations for Textual Tuples and then measure the graph similarity using Metrics Analysis.

Natural Language Processing was used to create the text tuples from psychology papers. In this project, I took those text tuples from three file types and use the information to create temporal dynamic graph visualizations. I then used graph metrics (number of nodes, centrality, density and pagerank) to get the structural similarity of the graphs relative to each other.
